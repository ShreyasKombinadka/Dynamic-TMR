# **Dynamic Triple Modular Redundancy (DTMR)**

Dynamic TMR is a fault-tolerant mechanism built to handle SEU (Single Event Upset) errors using Triple Modular Redundancy. Unlike conventional TMR, which consumes significant power by being active all the time, Dynamic TMR only activates when needed—otherwise, operations run normally. 

The DTMR is specifically triggered in radiation-prone environments where there's a high possibility of SEU events. By switching on only when necessary, it conserves power while providing reliability exactly when it matters most.
